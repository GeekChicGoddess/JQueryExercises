        <h3>Acadia</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cadillac Mountain, located within the park, is not only the highest mountain along the Atlantic Coast but also one of the first places to see the sunrise in the United States each morning. It sits at 1,530 feet.</li>
            <li>There are a total of 26 mountains in Acadia National Park.</li>
            <li>John D. Rockefeller Jr. was responsible for the construction of many of the miles of carriage roads in the park. He also donated all the land to the state of Maine to become a National Park.</li>
            <li>There is a rock formation in the park called Thunder Hole. It creates the sound of thunder when waves roll in and shoot air and water up through the cavern.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Arches</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The total size of Arches National Park is more than 76,000 acres. It was first made available to visitors in 1923. Now, more than 1 million arrive each year.</li>
            <li>Arches National Park trails are virtually overrun with stone arches; in total, there are over 2,000 recorded.</li>
            <li>Arches National Park history can be traced back over 10,000 years. This is when the first signs of humans appeared as signs carved into indigenous rock formations.</li>
            <li>During the summer, strong monsoons strike without notice making Arches National Park hiking a major challenge. In addition, because average temperatures hover around 94F, the season is very unstable. This is also, why most wildlife in this area is nocturnal.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Badlands</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The name 'badlands' is believed to originate from the Lakota people. They originally referred to the area encompassing Badlands National Park as 'land bad'. This is due to the rugged conditions of the area. French Canadians referred to the area as 'bad lands to travel through.</li>
            <li>President Franklin D. Roosevelt created Badlands National Monument by signing a proclamation.</li>
            <li>Congress declared the monument Badlands National Park in 1978.</li>
            <li>Descendants of the Native Americans that lived in the Badlands region before it was taken over by homesteaders and later declared a national park live in North Dakota as members of the Three Affiliated Tribes.</li>
